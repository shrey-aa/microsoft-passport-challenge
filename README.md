# microsoft-passport-challenge
The Microsoft Passport Challenge by MLH is open to anyone who wants to participate! 
Level-up your cloud skills by completing a series of 3 guided activities. 

1.) Here we need to create microsoft azure student account which gives us benefits like 
free access to azure cloud modules and services, microsoft tools and extra 100$ credit in our azure account.

2.) Next we will have to create a github repository. Here's mine naming, microsoft-passport-challenge.
I'm building animated form using Js.

3.) Final step is Using your Azure for Students subscription, deploy any Azure service. Itâ€™s incredibly easy to 
get started, with Quickstart Templates and user guides on Microsoft Docs. You can deploy any code you have from your 
Github repo directly into Azure as well.
